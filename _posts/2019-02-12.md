# React note

###Call `this.setState` from another function
```
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { weather: 'sunny' };
    this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this);
  }

  makeSomeFog() {
    this.setState({
      weather: 'foggy'
    });
  }
}
```
Due to the way that event handlers are bound in JavaScript, `this.toggleMood()` loses its `this` when it is used on line 20. Therefore, the expressions `this.state.mood` and `this.setState` won't mean what they're supposed to... unless you have already bound the correct this to `this.toggleMood`.

That is why we must bind `this.toggleMood` to this.
