## Containerization
Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

* Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
* Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
* Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
* Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
8 Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
* Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

## Image and containers
A container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, docker ps, just as you would in Linux.

## Container and VM
A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.
